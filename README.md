# ChatAway ðŸ’¬

## A React / Firebase Realtime Chat App

For this project I used ReactJS with pure css to create the front end.

For the backend I used Firebase Authentication amd Firestore.

URL


## Goals

My next goal is to turn this into a chrome extension that can read the tab url as the chatroom automatically.
